      <li>Open the browser console and go to the Debugger/Sources tab.</li>
      <li>Select the <code>./src/app.lua</code> file.</li>
      <li>Place a breakpoint on line 2.</li>
      <li>Refresh.</li>

    <p>
      Observe that in Firefox each step progresses to the next observable statement, as you might expect.
      However, in Chrome, when you step through the code, the highlight stays on line 4 for five clicks of the step over button each time.

      I believe this may be due to the fact that that single line of Lua code is translated to <a href="https://github.com/paulcuth/source-map-step-issue/blob/master/app.lua.js#L35-L38">a number of lines</a> in JavaScript. 
      The Chrome debugger appears to be stepping through the generated code statement by statement, rather than the code that is visible in the debugger.
      As a developer, the Firefox method is preferable/more appropriate.
